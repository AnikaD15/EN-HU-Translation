The general topic to be explored is "Language Translation". For our project, we 
will be developing a model that will translate English to Hungarian text.
Later, we will be developing another model for translating Hungarian to English 
text, and comparing the two models' accuracy. The dataset is OpenSubtitles 
(https://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles.php) which is a database of translated movie 
subtitles. This project will use the En-Hu and Hu-En files.
